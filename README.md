# Demo Spring MVC
Demo project made for learning purposes using Java and Spring MVC framework that follows the MVC architectural design pattern.

**Spring MVC** is a **web application framework** that is part of the **Spring Framework**. It is designed to make it easy to build web applications using the **Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern**.

In Spring MVC, the application is divided into **three main components: the Model, the View, and the Controller**. The **Model** represents the **data** and the **business logic** of the application, the **View** is responsible for **generating the HTML** that is sent to the clientâ€™s web browser, and the **Controller** acts as an **intermediary between the Model and the View**, **handling incoming HTTP requests and generating the appropriate response**.
